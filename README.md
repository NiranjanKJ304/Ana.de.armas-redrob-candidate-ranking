# 🤖 Redrob Intelligent Candidate Ranking System

An offline, CPU-only pipeline that ranks **100,000+ candidates** against a job description, detects honeypot/fake profiles, and outputs the **top 100** best-fit candidates with evidence-based reasoning.

> **🚀 Quick Start (Running the Project):**
> 1. **Install requirements:**
>    ```bash
>    pip install -r requirements.txt
>    ```
> 2. **Download the model (Optional - pre-downloads the model to reduce pipeline execution time):**
>    ```bash
>    python load_model.py
>    ```
> 3. **Run the ranking pipeline:**
>    ```bash
>    python run.py
>    ```

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** (required for `X | Y` type hint syntax)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **~2 GB disk space** (for dependencies + ML model)
- **≤16 GB RAM** (for processing 100K candidates)
- **Internet** (one-time only, for model download during setup)

---

## Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone or navigate to the project

```bash
cd path/to/hack2skill
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Download the embedding model

```bash
python load_model.py
```

This downloads `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` from HuggingFace, extracts it to `models/`, and verifies the installation. If the model already exists, it skips automatically.

### Step 4: Verify input files exist

```
hack2skill/
├── candidates.jsonl           ← Required (~487MB)
└── data/
    └── job_description.txt    ← Required (~2KB)
```

---

## Run the Pipeline

```bash
python run.py
```

This is the **only command needed** after setup. It will:
1. Check directories and create any missing ones
2. Verify the model exists (or auto-download it)
3. Validate input files
4. Execute all 10 pipeline stages
5. Output `output/submission.csv`

### Running with custom file paths:

By default, the script expects `candidates.jsonl` in the project root or in the `data/` directory. However, you can reference the file from **any directory on your computer** using command-line arguments:

```bash
python run.py --candidates C:\path\to\your\candidates.jsonl --jd data\job_description.txt --output output\submission.csv --top-k 100
```

#### CLI Options:
* `--candidates`: Path to the `candidates.jsonl` file (can be anywhere on your computer).
* `--jd`: Path to the job description file (defaults to `data/job_description.txt`).
* `--output`: Path to save the final CSV output (defaults to `output/submission.csv`).
* `--top-k`: Number of top candidates to output in the CSV (default: `100`).

## Input Files

### `candidates.jsonl`

One JSON object per line, each representing a candidate profile with:
- **Profile**: name, headline, summary, location, experience, title
- **Career History**: companies, titles, durations, descriptions
- **Education**: institutions, degrees, fields, tiers
- **Skills**: names, proficiency levels, endorsements
- **Redrob Signals**: platform engagement, recruiter response rate, GitHub activity

### `data/job_description.txt`

Plain text job description used for semantic similarity matching.

---

## Output Format

The pipeline generates `output/submission.csv`:

```csv
"candidate_id","rank","score","reasoning"
"CAND_0079387","1","1.0","AI Engineer with 6.9 years of experience..."
"CAND_0098846","2","0.97","AI Engineer with 7.6 years..."
...
"CAND_0054123","100","0.01","ML Engineer with 5.2 years..."
```

| Column | Type | Range | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `candidate_id` | string | — | Unique candidate identifier |
| `rank` | integer | 1–100 | 1 = best fit |
| `score` | float | 0.01–1.0 | Normalized relevance score |
| `reasoning` | string | ≤400 chars | Factual, evidence-based justification |

---

## Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Module | Description | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `parser.py` | Stream JSONL, convert to typed dataclasses | ~18s |
| 2 | `features.py` | Extract 60+ features (skills, career, education, behavioral) | ~70s |
| 3 | `scorer.py` | Compute 7 rule-based sub-scores (without semantic) | ~1s |
| 4 | `consistency.py` | Run 7 anomaly detectors (timelines, salary, skills) | ~1s |
| 5 | `honeypot.py` | Run 7 fraud detectors (buzzwords, title mismatch, stuffing) | ~29s |
| 6 | `ranker.py` | Pre-filter top 2,000 by adjusted score | <1s |
| 7 | `retrieval.py` | Encode JD + 2,000 candidates → cosine similarity | ~140s |
| 8 | `ranker.py` | Rescore with semantic, select top 100 | ~3s |
| 9 | `reasoning.py` | Generate evidence-based explanations | <1s |
| 10 | `exporter.py` | Normalize scores, write CSV, validate | <1s |
| **Total** | | | **~4.5 min** |

---

## Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Python 3.10+ | Core language |
| sentence-transformers | Semantic text embeddings |
| PyTorch | Neural network backend (CPU) |
| NumPy | Array operations, cosine similarity |
| orjson | Fast JSONL parsing |
| tqdm | Progress bars |
| requests | Model download (setup only) |
| pytest | Unit testing framework |

---

## Run Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Test Coverage (40 tests)

| Module | Tests |
|---|---|
| `parser.py` | 11 tests — parsing, streaming, error handling |
| `features.py` | 8 tests — feature flags, counts, text builder |
| `scorer.py` | 7 tests — score ranges, all-scores dict, scaling |
| `consistency.py` | 4 tests — anomaly detection, penalty ranges |
| `honeypot.py` | 6 tests — genuine vs honeypot separation |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows | `run.py` auto-sets UTF-8 encoding. If using `src/main.py` directly, set `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` |
| Model download fails | Check internet connection, then retry `python load_model.py` |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| `FileNotFoundError: candidates.jsonl` | Ensure `candidates.jsonl` is in the project root or `data/` directory |
| Out of memory | The pipeline uses ≤16 GB RAM. Close other applications if needed |
| Runtime > 5 minutes | Expected on slower CPUs. The dynamic pre-filter caps embedding at 2,000 candidates |

---

## Future Improvements

- **GPU acceleration** — Use CUDA for embedding to reduce Stage 7 from ~140s to ~10s
- **Model caching** — Cache embeddings to disk for repeated runs with the same candidates
- **Configurable weights** — Expose scoring weights as a YAML/JSON config file
- **Batch processing** — Process candidates in chunks for datasets larger than 100K
- **Additional models** — Support larger embedding models (e.g., BGE-base, E5-large) for improved accuracy
- **API wrapper** — Optional REST API for integration with HR platforms
